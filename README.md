# Tracker.py

ü•ó Daily Calorie Tracker CLI
üìò Overview

A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool built in Python to help users log their meals, calculate total and average calorie intake, compare against a user-defined daily limit, and optionally save the session as a report file.
This mini project was created for the course: Programming for Problem Solving using Python.

üß© Project Description

tracker.py is a lightweight Python script that:

Prompts the user for a daily calorie limit

Collects meal names and calorie values

Computes total and average calories

Warns if the limit is exceeded

Displays a formatted summary table

Optionally saves the session log to calorie_log.txt

| **Objective**              | **How Addressed**                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `input()`, type conversion | Used for numeric (float/int) and text inputs |
| Lists & data storage       | Parallel lists: `meal_names`, `calorie_val`  |
| Arithmetic & comparison    | Total, average, limit comparison, warning    |
| String formatting          | f-strings, `\n`, `\t`, decorative lines      |
| File I/O                   | Writes structured log with timestamp         |
| Logical thinking           | Structured task flow (Tasks 1‚Äì6)             |

| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Task 1         | Header comments + welcome prints                     |
| Task 2         | Loop over user-specified meal count; append to lists |
| Task 3         | Use `sum()` for total; compute average               |
| Task 4         | If total exceeds daily limit ‚Üí show warning          |
| Task 5         | Display formatted table with tabs and lines          |
| Task 6 (Bonus) | Optional save with timestamp using `datetime`        |
